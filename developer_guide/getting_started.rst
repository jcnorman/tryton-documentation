Getting Started
===============


Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------
In the previous chapter you have seen how to install tryton client on your
machine. Now, lets start with setting up the development environment for
tryton.

Steps for setting up a development environment for tryton.

1. First thing is to have Python2 running on your system.
   You can check if python is installed by typing **python2** in a console window
   and pressing **Enter**.
   If python is installed an interactive shell will open, printing out version info
   and **>>>**
   You can exit by calling the function **exit()** or by pressing **ctrl+d**

2. Next, Install Postgres database. Steps for installing Postgres can be
   found from `Postgres Installation <http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides/>`_
   Install the database and give the database user postgres a new
   password.

3. Set up the virtual environment and install tryton client and trytond.
   You can directly install Tryton using pip command-line tool in your
   computer or virtualev.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install trytond
        $ pip install tryton_module_name

    Replace module_name with the name of the module you want to install


Using HgNested
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`HgNested <http://code.google.com/p/hgnested/>`_ is a mercuarial extension
used to work on nested repositories. In order to install hgnested you must run:

::

  pip install hgnested

Once installed you can checkout the lastest sources by executing:

::

  hg nclone http://hg.tryton.org/trytond

This will also clone all the modules in trytond/modules.

In order to run the tryton server you must install all the requirements as
described on the `Wiki <http://code.google.com/p/tryton/wiki/Requirements#Requirements_for_the_Tryton_Server>`_.

After this you can run your server with:

::

  trytond/bin/trytond

Using virtualenvwrappers templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Openlabs guys have created a virtualenvwrapper template to get a virtualenv
created with all the required dependencies (except your database drivers).

You can install it executing:

::

  pip install virtualenvwrapper.tryton

You can create a virtualenv with the latest version of tryton running:

::

  mkproject -t tryton virtualenv_name

In the virtualenv you can run your tryton server by executing:

::

  trytond


For more information about available templates please refer to
`virtualenvwrapper.tryton repository <https://github.com/openlabs/virtualenvwrapper.tryton>`_

Hello World (in progress)
-------------------------

Almost every Tryton functionality that you are going to develop on a daily
basis is enclosed into the modules. In order to get an idea of available
modules you should take a look inside trytond/modules. You will view many
folders in the modules. Each one comprises one set of facilities that can
be installed and will be available to the end users. Some examples are
company, country, currency and party.

In order to create your own module, your first step is to create a folder
inside the aforementioned directory. In this hello world tutorial we are going
to create a simple library control module:

::

    TRYTOND_HOME/trytond/modules$ mkdir library

As our first step, we are going to create the following files:

* tryton.cfg
* __init__.py
* library.py

Let's see the contents and purpose of each one in detail:

tryton.cfg
~~~~~~~~~~

This file must be present at the root of your module's directory. It contains
the version of the module and a list of the xml files the module contains. Our
module does not contain any xml files yet. It may also include a list of the
modules it depends on. Later, we will see the correct syntax to include those
references.

::

    [tryton]
    version=2.8.0

In the example above, we are stating that this module is meant to be used with
Tryton 2.8.0. You can check the tryton.cfg files of the existing modules to
view their respective structure.


\__init__.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file must be present at the root of your module's directory. It serves
two main purposes: it transforms your directory into a Python visible package
(according to Python general rules) and it also registers in the *Pool* the
entity classes of the module.

For now, you can think of the *Pool* as a "in memory synchronized image" of
your database, because Tryton follows the so called *active record* pattern.
Tryton takes care of database table creation and of the mapping between the
in-memory representation of the entity and the respective columns in the
database. It also takes care of the synchronization of the data loaded in your
in-memory entities and the persistent data on the database.

Whenever we are building a module in Tryton, we deal with a high-level,
object-oriented representation of our entities. Generally, we are free from
writing explicit SQL or python-sql instructions, but in order for this *magic*
to happen, Tryton's :py:class:`~trytond.pool.Pool` must be "aware" of the
existence of your entity classes.

::

    from trytond.pool import Pool
    from .library import *

    def register():
        Pool.register(
            Book,
            module='library', type_='model'
        )

In the example above, we are registering the *Book* class into the *Pool*.
Whenever the trytond service runs, it starts with initializing every module
that is installed (more on that in the coming lines), i.e., it performs the
regular Python initialization of packages. That means the execution of the
code contained inside the __init__.py.

If you are unfamiliar with the package initialization, you can think of it as
performing an analogous role as the __init__ method inside a Python class,
but, in this case, it performs initialization tasks semantically relative to
the whole package.

library.py
~~~~~~~~~~

This file must be present at the root of your module's directory. According to
a domain model, it contains the entity classes.


If your domain model is a commercial enterprise, your domain model would
contain entities such as *SaleOrder*, *Product*, *Customer* and so on. Our
tutorial here is proposing a library domain model, where you would expect to
find *Book*, *Author*, *Publisher*, etc. A domain model encompasses real world
objects that your software solution is expected to deal with.

In our tutorial, we are going to have a simple Book model. It has some fields
associated with it: *title*, *isbn*, *subject*, *abstract*.

Each field has a **Type**. This type determines many aspects and behaviours
of the application. For instance,

* :py:class:`~trytond.model.fields.Char` field will be created as a
  *Char Varying* column inside the database.
* :py:class:`~trytond.model.fields.Text` field will be displayed as a large
  text box in the Tryton Client window and so on.

In order to know every field avaliable, you can consult the
`API reference <http://doc.tryton.org/3.0/trytond/doc/ref/models/fields.html#ref-models-fields>`_.


::

    from trytond.model import ModelView, ModelSQL, fields

    # list of all classes in the file
    __all__ = ['Book']


    class Book(ModelSQL, ModelView):
        # description
        'Book'
        # Internal class name. Always used as a reference inside Tryton
        # default: <modules name> + . + <class name> on Tryton
        # and on database <modules name> + _ + <class name>
        __name__ = 'library.book'
        title = fields.Char('Title', required=True)
        isbn = fields.Char('ISBN')
        subject = fields.Char('Subject')
        abstract = fields.Text('Abstract')

In our example we have defined four fields in the class. Tryton will
automatically create a table in the database called **library_book**,
consisting of **nine** columns: the four defined above and another five that
are present on every column of the database:

* id
* create_date
* write_date
* create_uid
* write_uid

The first column is the **surrogate primary key** of the table. The following
ones are self-explanatory, and are created for auditing purposes. In general,
we should not worry about those columns, because Tryton takes care of them for us.

After creating the directory and the three files above, the trytond server
should be started using the following flags:

::

    TRYTOND_HOME/trytond/bin/trytond -d NAME_OF_THE_DATABASE -i library


The -d flag indicates the name of the database and the -i flag indicates that
the module library should be installed.

When you login into the Tryton client after the above procedure, you are not
going to see any changes yet, because till now, we have netiher defined the
windows (views in Tryton's parlance), nor we have defined the menus or actions
to open those windows.

If you access the defined database, you are going to see the the aforementioned
table created.

What we have done so far: We have created a module, we have installed that
module inside Tryton server, we have defined an entity class and Tryton has
created the corresponding table in the database for us. All that with no more
than 20 LOC total! Awesome!


Creating Menus
--------------

Now we have to make the user interface for our module. We need to create a
menu, a menu item and the windows to be able to input and access data.

First we are going to create, on the root of our module, a **library.xml**
file. This file must be listed on the **tryton.cfg** file, as we have mentioned
before. So edit it:

::

    [tryton]
    version=2.8.0

    xml:
        library.xml

Next, lets edit the library.xml file so it will contain the declaration of our
menu and its respective menu item (submenu):

library.xml
~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <tryton>
        <data>
            <menuitem name="Library" sequence="0" id="menu_library"/>
            <menuitem name="Books" parent="menu_library" id="menu_books"/>
        </data>
    </tryton>

Observe that this file is a *regular* xml file. So it starts with the ordinary
xml version declaration at the top, and it has as its master element the
*tryton* element, followed by a *data* element. The other elements will all be
children of *data*

In the xml file above we have declared two *menuitems*. The first one, named
*Library* will be placed on the root menu of Tryton client. Observe that it
has, besides the name attribute, a sequence, that indicates the position of the
menu, and an id, that must be **unique**. This id will identify this element
to the rest of the software. It will be placed on the root menu because it has
no parents.

The second *menuitem*, named *Books* has another element: a *parent* element,
which points to the id of the former menu (*id="menu_library"*), indicating
that it is going to be nested on the first one.

Let's update the Tryton Server, installing the new modifications:

::

    TRYTOND_HOME/trytond/bin/trytond -d NAME_OF_THE_DATABASE -u library

Notice, now, that we have changed the flag from **-i** (install) to **-u**
(update) to be in accordance with the fact that the module is already installed
and only need to be updated.

Let's also restart the Tryton client now. Remember to start it with the **-d**
(development) flag, so it can update the cache and show the changes we have
just made:

::

    TRYTON_HOME/tryton/bin/tryton -d

When you log in again on the client, you are going to see that the menu
*Library* and the submenu *Books* have been created.

But the menus do nothing yet. We have only declared the **existence** of the
menus, but we have not yet declared the **actions** those menus execute.

What we are going to do now is to create an action that will be triggered by
the submenu *Books*. The first menu *Library* will trigger no action, because
we want it to be only a summary menu. The books menu, though, will open the
windows where we are going to input and browse the books records.

Creating Reports
----------------
Add the following line to the file 'library.xml' into the /data tag :

.. code-block:: xml

        <!-- First thing: define the report itself,
        model: Target-Model
        report_name: the report class' __name__
        report: template ods-file
        -->
        <record model="ir.action.report" id="report_library">
            <field name="name">Book</field>
            <field name="model">library.Book</field>
            <field name="report_name">library.book</field>
            <field name="report">library/book.odt</field>
        </record>
        <!-- Second we register a keyword
        (so we can call the report from tryton client) -->
        <record model="ir.action.keyword" id="report_library_book">
            <field name="keyword">form_print</field>
            <field name="model">library.book,-1</field>
            <field name="action" ref="report_library"/>
        </record>

Now create the file book.odt inside your module.
In this file add the following lines by adding a placeholder in your odt
file.

.. code-block:: xml

   <for each="library in objects">
   <library.title>
   </for>

.. tip::

    placeholders can be inserted in libreoffice by pressing **ctrl+f2**
    **functions -> placeholder -> text**

In case you are dealing with ods file. For adding a placeholder you have
to add a hyperlink.
